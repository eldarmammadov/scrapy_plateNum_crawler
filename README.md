# scrapy_plateNum_crawler
with python scrapy my crawler scripts takes data from data.xlsx with pandas framework then scrapes data-outputs it as output_res excel file

With scrapy framework, script goes to URL of UK registration plates for cars,

looks for special plate numbers which are in xlsx file, reads it

searchs for it, and fetches price data if it exists, if not puts '-' and writes down exact same xlsx formatted Excel file

I have used Scrapy framework on  this project

Reading and writing for Excel file I used pandas framework
